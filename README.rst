NEAT (NEural Analysis Toolkit)
==============================

Introduction
------------

NEAT is a python library for the study, simulation and simplification of
morphological neuron models. NEAT accepts morphologies in the *de facto*
standard .swc format [Cannon1998]_, and implements high-level tools to interact
with and analyze the morphologies.

NEAT also allows for the convenient definition of morphological neuron models.
These models can be simulated, through an interface with the NEURON [Carnevale2004]_ 
and NEST [Gewaltig2007]_ simulators, or can be analyzed with two classical methods: 
*(i)* the separation of variables method [Major1993]_ to obtain impedance kernels 
as a superposition of exponentials and *(ii)* Koch's method to compute impedances
with linearized ion channels analytically in the frequency domain [Koch1985]_.
Furthermore, NEAT implements the neural evaluation tree framework [Wybo2019]_
and an associated C++ simulator, to analyze subunit independence.

Finally, NEAT implements a new and powerful method to simplify morphological
neuron models into compartmental models with few compartments [Wybo2021]_. For
these models, NEAT provides NEURON and NEST interfaces so that they can be
simulated directly.

Documentation
-------------

Documentation for an older version of NEAT (0.9.2) available `here <https://neatdend.readthedocs.io>`_
Note that a new documentation website for the current version (1.0-rc1) is currently
under construction. Please see the changelog (`changelog/v.1.0.md`) for an overview of
the changes.

Installation
------------

**Install**

Note: The following instructions are for Linux and Max OSX systems and only use
command line tools. Please follow the appropriate manuals for Windows systems or
tools with graphical interfaces. The most recent version, NEAT 1.0-rc1 can be 
installed from the master branch.

.. code-block:: shell

   git clone git@github.com:unibe-cns/NEAT.git
   cd NEAT
   pip install .

**Post-Install**

Note that if you install NEAT with pip, as above, NEURON will automatically be installed as well.
To use NEAT with `NEST <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/index.html>`_, 
you need to manually install NEST on your system, by following the detailed
`installation instructions <https://nest-simulator.readthedocs.io/en/stable/installation/index.html>`_.

**Testing the installation**

NEAT make the shell command `neatmodels` available to compile NEAT-defined ion channels
into for NEURON or NEST, so that they can be simulated.
You can test whether this command is available by installing the default ion channels of NEAT:

.. code-block:: shell

    neatmodels install default

This installs the default channels for NEURON. To install them for NEST, use:

.. code-block:: shell

    neatmodels install default -s nest
